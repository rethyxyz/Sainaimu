# TODO
- [ ] Ensure that *BSD, and other Unixes use auth.log, or whatever. I think it may be an OpenSSH or Systemd thing.
- [ ] Split grep line into smaller bits portions.
    - Even better, implement a Python implementation instead of a Shell call.
- [ ] Implement a SEVERITY option to blocking SSH access for just SSH, SSH and Web, or ALL.
    - This should be a global, and read from the configuration file.
- [ ] Make RemoveStringFromArray function less ugly.
